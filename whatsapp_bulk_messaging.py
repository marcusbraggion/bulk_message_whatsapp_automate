# Defining a function named send_whatsapp which takes three arguments:
# data_file_excel: the path to an Excel file containing contact information
# message_file_text: the path to a text file containing the message to be sent
# x_cord and y_cord: the coordinates of the mouse click to be performed (default values are set to the location of the send button in WhatsApp Web)

def send_whatsapp(data_file_excel, msg:str, x_cord=830, y_cord=954):
    """
    Sends WhatsApp messages to multiple contacts using data from an Excel file and a message template.
    
    Args:
        data_file_excel (str): The path to the Excel file containing contact information.
        message_file_text (str): The path to the text file containing the message template.
        x_cord (int, optional): The x-coordinate of the mouse click to send the message. Defaults to 830.
        y_cord (int, optional): The y-coordinate of the mouse click to send the message. Defaults to 954.
    
    Returns:
        None
    
    This function reads the contents of an Excel file and a message template file. It then extracts the names and 
    contact numbers from the Excel file and formats the message template with the name of each recipient. It opens 
    the WhatsApp Web URL for each contact and message, simulates a mouse click to send the message, and dismisses 
    the send confirmation pop-up. The function then closes the WhatsApp Web tab after a delay. The function prints a 
    message indicating the number of messages sent after each message is sent. Finally, the function prints a message 
    indicating that the function has completed execution.
